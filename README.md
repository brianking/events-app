#events-app
Initially intended as a mobile Web app for Mozilla community events. Hopefully it will be evolve to be useful for everyone having an event.

## Mockups
These are loose mockups of what the app could look like once complete… iconography and terminology to be determined still.

### Home / Landing
In this view you can see not only the basis of the UI, but also what in-app notifications could potentially look like.

### Schedule / What's Next?
Here we see how stars can be used to mark sessions of interest… these will then be listed in chronological order under the "pinned" tab.

### Tracks
This view shows us simply what tracks there are, and gives us the option to "pin" all session under that track, keeping the user up-to-date on any session changes under that track

### Session Details View
In the session details view we get all the available details on a session, as well as if it is "pinned" or not.
